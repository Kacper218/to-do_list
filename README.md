  # to-do_list

This is my third project that I'm currently working on to pratice my skills in frontweb development.

The page is simple to-do list with add, delete and mark done functions.

I'm using VS Code editor with VIM extension.

I just started so it's pretty simple so far, but im trying to do my best.

Website is in polish language.
